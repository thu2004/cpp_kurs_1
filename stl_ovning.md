Let focus on the C++ Standard Library containers. Here is a detailed summary along with examples:

### Overview of Containers

C++ containers, provided by the Standard Library, offer a collection of classes used to store and organize data. Containers can broadly be divided into:

1. **Sequential Containers** - List, Vector, Forward List, Deque.
2. **Associative Containers** - Maps, Multimaps, Sets, and Multisets.
3. **Unordered Containers**.
4. **Special-Purpose Containers**.

### Examples and Code Snippets

#### Working with Pairs and Tuples

* **Pairs** allow for association of two values.
    
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <utility>
    using namespace std;
    
    int main() {
        pair<string, int> name_age = make_pair("Alice", 30);
        cout << "Name: " << name_age.first << ", Age: " << name_age.second << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    This code demonstrates creating and accessing values in a pair​(20170807-1504-cet-1-boo…).

#### Sequential Containers

* **Vector** is a dynamically resizable array.
    
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <vector>
    using namespace std;
    
    int main() {
        vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        nums.push_back(5);
        for(int num : nums) {
            cout << num << " ";
        }
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    This example shows the use of `push_back` and iteration over elements.
    
* **List** and **Forward List** provide fast insertion and removal, particularly when positions within the list are known.
    

#### Associative Containers

* **Map** stores key-value pairs and sorts by key.
    
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <map>
    using namespace std;
    
    int main() {
        map<string, int> phonebook;
        phonebook["John"] = 123456;
        phonebook["Alice"] = 654321;
    
        for(const auto& [name, number] : phonebook) {
            cout << name << ": " << number << endl;
        }
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    This demonstrates storing and accessing elements in a `map`.

#### Using Iterators

* Iterators provide a way to traverse containers.
    
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <vector>
    using namespace std;
    
    int main() {
        vector<int> v = {10, 20, 30};
        for(auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) {
            cout << *it << " ";
        }
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    This code illustrates basic iterator usage for a vector.

#### Algorithms with Containers

* Standard Library algorithms can be used with containers for operations like sorting, finding, and transforming data.

Here are ten exercises focus on C++ Standard Library containers and their usage:

### Exercises for containers

1. **Exercise 1 - Working with Pairs:** Create a program that uses a `pair` to store the name and age of three different people. Display their details using the `first` and `second` members.
    
2. **Exercise 2 - Vector Operations:** Create a `vector<int>` containing numbers from 1 to 10. Remove all even numbers from the vector and display the contents after the removal.
    
3. **Exercise 3 - Using Lists:** Write a program that uses a `std::list` to store a series of strings. Add five strings, insert a new string at the beginning, and remove one from the middle. Display the list contents at each stage.
    
4. **Exercise 4 - Map for a Phonebook:** Create a `map<string, int>` to simulate a phonebook. Allow the user to add entries, remove an entry by name, and find a phone number given a name. Display the entire phonebook contents at the end.
    
5. **Exercise 5 - Iterator Practice:** Use a `vector` to store a series of `int` values. Iterate over the vector using an iterator and multiply each value by 2. Display the modified vector.
    
6. **Exercise 6 - Unordered Map Example:** Create an `unordered_map<string, double>` to store product names and their prices. Add five entries, then modify the price of one product and display all the entries.
    
7. **Exercise 7 - Set Operations:** Use a `set<int>` to store unique integers entered by the user. Print the elements in sorted order. Try inserting a duplicate value and observe the behavior.
    
8. **Exercise 8 - Working with Deque:** Use a `std::deque<int>` to simulate a queue of tasks. Add tasks at the back and remove from the front, simulating a first-in, first-out (FIFO) behavior. Display the queue contents after each operation.
    
9. **Exercise 9 - Tuples and Structured Bindings:** Create a `tuple<string, int, double>` to store a person's name, age, and weight. Use structured bindings to access and display each element of the tuple.
    
10. **Exercise 10 - Using Standard Library Algorithms:** Create a `vector<int>` with random values. Use the Standard Library algorithm `std::sort` to sort the vector and then use `std::find` to search for a specific number. Display whether the number was found and its position.
    

These exercises will help reinforce your understanding of C++ containers, iterators, and Standard Library algorithms


Here is a new set of exercises focused on practicing with C++ Standard Library algorithms:

### Exercises for C++ Algorithms

1. **Exercise 1 - Sorting a Vector:** Create a `vector<int>` with 10 random integers. Use `std::sort` to sort the vector in ascending order and then display the sorted vector.
    
2. **Exercise 2 - Finding Elements:** Use `std::vector<int>` with at least 10 elements. Use the `std::find` algorithm to check if a specific value entered by the user exists in the vector. If found, print the index; otherwise, display a message saying it was not found.
    
3. **Exercise 3 - Counting Elements:** Create a `vector<int>` and populate it with multiple occurrences of some values. Use `std::count` to count the number of times a specific value appears in the vector and display the result.
    
4. **Exercise 4 - Removing Elements:** Create a `list<int>` with values from 1 to 10. Use `std::remove_if` to remove all odd numbers from the list and display the resulting list.
    
5. **Exercise 5 - Transforming Elements:** Create a `vector<int>` with elements 1 through 10. Use `std::transform` to create a new vector where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the original vector. Display both vectors.
    
6. **Exercise 6 - Min and Max Elements:** Create a `vector<int>` and populate it with random numbers. Use `std::min_element` and `std::max_element` to find the smallest and largest elements and display their values.
    
7. **Exercise 7 - Partial Sum:** Use a `vector<int>` of integers and apply `std::partial_sum` to create a new vector where each element is the sum of all preceding elements (including itself). Display the original and the resulting vectors.
    
8. **Exercise 8 - Reversing a Range:** Create a `deque<int>` containing numbers from 1 to 10. Use `std::reverse` to reverse the elements and display the result.
    
9. **Exercise 9 - Copy and Unique Elements:** Create a `vector<int>` with duplicate elements. Use `std::unique` and `std::copy` to create a new vector that contains only unique elements. Display both vectors.
    
10. **Exercise 10 - Sorting a Custom Comparator:** Create a `vector<pair<string, int>>` representing names and their ages. Use `std::sort` with a custom comparator to sort the vector by age in descending order and then display the sorted elements.
    

These exercises focus on a variety of algorithms in the Standard Library to help you get hands-on experience with data manipulation, transformations, sorting, and more.
